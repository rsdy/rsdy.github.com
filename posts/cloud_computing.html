<p>Cloud computing today is indeed a popular phenomena. iStuff work together like they're supposed to, Google's solution is arguably even more sophisticated, while Microsoft is catching up (hopefully) rapidly.</p>
<p>It is nice to have everything available every time, and I'm quite sure everybody loves this. That's a lot of 'every' in one sentence. Let me repeat the essence: everything, every time, everybody. Anywhere you might be.</p>
<p>We have been warned by many conspiracy theories, dystopias, and cyberpunk movies that such a brilliantly easy and convenient system can turn against us, either by gaining consciousness of its own, which is currently less probable, or by having someone abuse it -- or just use it. After all, it is only a matter of perspective.</p>
<p>Our conspiracy theories about a surveillance society seem to get confirmed, and, living in the UK, the extensive CCTV network -- for my own good -- quite disturbingly resembles episodes from Ghost in the Shell.</p>
<p>The clouds, into which we willingly upload our stuff -- be it music or movies we purchased, pirated, or made ourselves -- are services run by companies that are big enough to pose the question: which side are they on? Since we can't look into these magic black holes that sip up our infinite data, we cannot be sure. We also cannot be sure about their competence in ensuring the integrity and privacy of our stuff.</p>
<p>I don't want to elaborate how bad the situation is and that the doom is certainly near. We've survived The Apocalypse another time last year. Also, I do not believe these companies are evil. They just want their fair share of profit, and comply with the requirements of authorities to stay in business. That's fine. I just want my privacy.</p>
<p>For long, I haven't found a viable usecase for a tablet, but as I'm reading more and more recently, I've decided that it's a better solution than stashing up hardcover books, printed slides, and lecture notes, and probably more versatile and shiny than an e-book reader. However, there's a catch. Nexus 7 has lots of storage. Storage that I don't need on my tablet. This made me think.</p>
<p>Epinephrine, my Raspberry Pi at home, has an expandable storage, so has my laptop, and my phone. My VPS has some free space, too, and a 32Gb Nexus 7 would be sleeping inside WiFi coverage most of the time. Adding all the free space together, I'm sitting on probably over a 100Gb of unused, and unusable storage.</p>
<p>Why the hack would I pay to a cloud storage provider that hosts my stuff, while all these devices could -- and should -- use all their available storage to serve me wherever I am and whenever I want? Just like a cloud, but without the centralized part. Most importantly, there should not be a single node which has higher priority than the others. If one of them disconnects for some reason, there should be at least one other that can serve the same piece of data. If I run out of space, it should be trivial to pull in some more resources from regular cloud, since everything should be stored encrypted, anyway. An emergency kill-switch would also be nice to have.</p>
<p>And so, the idea of KitchenSync is dead -- the name has been for long, due to a collision. It is now superseded by something better that has no name yet. With so many questions buzzing in my head, that's the least of my concerns. Now it's time to experiment.</p>
