			<header><h1>What I learned on the first day of my crowdfunding campaign, without funders</h1><small>Published: <time datetime="2012-09-06" pubdate>06 September 2012</time></small></header>
<p>Long before I resigned from my position as a developer I had been planning to start a crowdfunding campaign. I have had the idea for some time, but it was only after a couple of days after I have received my first Raspberry Pi when the plans became clear in my head. And I was very careful who to share it with, and when. Not because I was afraid someone might steal it, but because I wasn't quite sure I can even start a campaign like this.</p>
<p>Everyone I told my great idea was very supportive. Go ahead, they said, it will be fine, they said. And so I went on, and did what I could. I've seen many a project raise lots of money in the first days of its crowdfunding campaign, so I thought what the hell, I can do too!</p>
<p>What does it take? Share it on Reddit, share it on HackerNews, Facebook, Twitter, and the link will get to many people, and everybody will want to buy in. After all, all the non-geeks I talked to about <a href="https://indiegogo.com/kitchensync">KitchenSync</a> seemed to like my project.</p>
<p>Of course, things often don't work out as a naive student thinks. The people I counted on weren't so in the mood of sharing like I had thought they would be. Who have come across the link on either Reddit or HackerNews, though, have also been very supportive and had great ideas. Nevertheless, none of them wanted to contribute their hard-earned cash to me.</p>
<p>So I realised I didn't, and still don't have a plan B on how to spread the link. Maybe I should send it to a couple of more mailing lists I follow, but I don't really know how they would take a shameless self-advertisement, which essentially begs for their money, without any guarrantee on any actual results.</p>
<p>Because this is what crowdfunding is about: you earn people's trust, and they give you their money. How can I earn their trust? With already running projects, and a cool story. I think I have a cool story, so it's a tick. Others might think otherwise, but I'm confident I'm a cool guy. However, if you check out my GitHub account, all you can find are half-done Arduino projects, with one or two exceptions, that I'm actually proud of, along with my desktop and shell configurations, that I'm extremely proud of. But those aren't the things most people can relate to or even understand. Those are pure geek porn.</p>
<p>I don't have a tech or even a personal blog. I abandoned my <a href="https://rsdy.blogs.balabit.com/">old tech blog</a> when I quit my job, and I'm not really eager to go back, and now, when I will upload this blog post to GitHub, I realise it seems like this is my first blog post on the interwebs. How am I even willing to earn people's trust, when they have no evidence that I actually know what I'm talking about?</p>
<p>Even though I'm sure I know enough to complete the project, I have nothing to prove I'm up for the task and will eventually deliver. I screwed this up many years ago when I started to slack off from writing, and even pulled my blog offline. But even that blog was in Hungarian, my native language, and was more of a personal blog than a techblog documenting the amazing stuff I had done. I actually was making many cool projects throughout high school, when that blog was still online, and not once did I mention those projects.</p>
<p>I also realised that with <a href="http://techblog.vsza.hu">one apparent exception</a>, the people I know, and my closest friends are not going to contribute money to the project. That is fine, and I'm not blaming them. People in Hungary don't really buy stuff on the Internet with credit cards, let alone spend their money on something they won't receive within a week. I knew that all along. Friends supported me with words, and that's enough. But as the Indiegogo tips and tricks page mentioned, I should base 25% of my income on the family and closest friends, which is logical: they are supposed to be the ones who trust me enough to invest money in me, and with their contributions, they convince others to do so as well.</p>
<p>But why would they spend their money on me, when they have no interest in my project whatsoever? Even if they find the idea cool, it's not going to benefit them in any way, or at least they don't think so.</p>
<p>Am I targeting the geeks after all? Did I really think this through? Do people actually care about their privacy, or are they most comfortable using whatever cloud services they find?</p>
<p>I had lots of time to think, because it was a long day yesterday. I didn't want to go to sleep before I knew I did everything I could to set off my project. It was a long day, for sure. I was furious answering the questions on IRC, HackerNews and Reddit, but nothing seemed to catch people's attention. So here you are, the things that I screwed up:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you can't rely on your family and friends to contribute money, people won't think this is a worthy project. When they see it isn't funded yet, they're most likely to just close the tab and move on.</li>
<li>if people think your projects are fascinating that doesn't mean they're going to invest. You get positive responses, but not constructive criticism. Most people wish you luck, but don't share. You need a reliable audience who reshare from the very beginning.</li>
<li>know who you are targeting. If your closest friends are not willing to contribute money, you'll most likely fail. You need to have the critical mass who contribute money, then others may follow.</li>
<li>when you're making software, you need a public track record. Create something amazing, then you can make the crowd fund something more amazing.</li>
<li>you need to blog. You need to show you have an understanding of what you do. People want to relate to you.</li>
<li>don't be afraid to spread your project. People like entrepreneurs. They'll understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you'll have more luck than I had in the first days. If you've come across this post, you might want to check out my <a href="https://indiegogo.com/kitchensync">Indiegogo page</a>, and I'd be grateful for a contribution and a share as well.</p>
