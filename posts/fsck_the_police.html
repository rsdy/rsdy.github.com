<p>Recently, the fact that I started using Android without root lurged me into weaking on the personal cloud concept a little further. After deciding that the final name of the project won't be KitchenSync, actually syncing my phone to my Raspberry Pi at home was quite <a href="https://github.com/KitchenSync/raspberry_configuration">easy</a>. Setting up the connection through <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> was quite straightforward, but it had two major problems. First, most apps don't play nice with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android">Tor on Android</a>, and I needed a rooted phone to circumvent this limitation. Second, Tor's bandwith made it hard to extend the range of services the Raspberry Pi offered, namely calendar and contact <a href="http://baikal-server.com/">sync</a>, so I decided to take a peek at the situation from a different perspective.</p>
<p>Without giving it much thought, I hooked up my Raspberry Pi at home to the <a href="https://strongswan.org/">IPsec</a> connection I usually use for tunneling on hostile networks. I consider a virtual private server a nice thing to have. It handles my mail, and, among all sorts of other things, acts as a secure tunnel towards the Internet when I'm on hostile networks. As the saying goes, now I two problems.</p>
<p>I have a 4-device private cloud, where every client connects to the VPS. This is easy because it has a domain name and is directly routed to the Internet, essentially using a star-topology. Originally, I wanted to make the KitchenSync thing as decentralised as possible, so this made me think about the implications.</p>
<p>The advantage of using Tor over the IPsec star above is that it hides the peers' locations, and doesn't depend on a single point of failure. On the other hand, I have a completely legitimate reason to connect to the VPS that has a domain registered on my name, hosts my public email, etcetera. While these topologies migth seem to be serving completely different purposes, they actually complement each other very well.</p>
<p>The VPS can act as a frontend to all the various services that are run by the backend Raspberry Pies connecting through Tor, reverse-proxying requests. There will be a performance impact, but the location of the backends is hidden, and there's no Tor traffic originating from my mobile devices, which might or might not be a good thing under different circumstances. Hiding all the dirty work under the hood, running a Tor relay on the Internet-facing host will make the traffic towards the backends blend in with the constant load of Tor traffic through the box.</p>
<p>If I understand it right, this vaguely resembles what The Pirate Bay is doing right now, operating in the cloud. More importantly, without the hidden service twist, this is what most load-balancers everywhere else do.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that you probably don't need Tor support on all your devices if you want to host your services in the Dark Net. As a techie, you probably have a VPS of some sort anyway, and setting up this topology will get you better security and privacy than using corporate clouds. While Tor is more advanced in this perspective, running IPsec or SSH on port 443 could help you establish connections that get through most routers. Even if the outpost is compromised, the real location of the data will stay hidden. Employing some sort of caching on the public VPS could enhance the bandwith, but probably has implications and challenges I haven't thought about.</p>
<p>So what is this good for? I can reach my mail, files, chats from all my devices in a native way. Apart from the fabulous CardDAV-Sync and CalDAV-Sync apps from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Marten+Gajda">Marten Gajda</a>, I'm using open source software. Services talk with clients through standard protocols, through encrypted channels, and possibly no data is stored unencrypted. Marten confirmed he's going to open source his sync apps sometime in the future. With some work I could set up a cloud similar in services to those offered by popular companies, based on open source software and reasonably good security practices. Packaging it up properly, tough, to attract users, will take a huge effort.</p>
