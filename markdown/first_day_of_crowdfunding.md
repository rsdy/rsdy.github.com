% What I learned on the first day of my crowdfunding campaign, without funders

Long before I resigned from my position as a developer I had been planning to
start a crowdfunding campaign. I have had the idea for some time, but it was
only after a couple of days after I have received my first Raspberry Pi when the
plans became clear in my head. And I was very careful who to share it with, and
when. Not because I was afraid someone might steal it, but because I wasn't
quite sure I can even start a campaign like this.

Everyone I told my great idea was very supportive. Go ahead, they said, it will
be fine, they said. And so I went on, and did what I could. I've seen many a
project raise lots of money in the first days of its crowdfunding campaign, so I
thought what the hell, I can do too!

What does it take? Share it on Reddit, share it on HackerNews, Facebook,
Twitter, and the link will get to many people, and everybody will want to buy
in. After all, all the non-geeks I talked to about
[KitchenSync](https://indiegogo.com/kitchensync) seemed to like my project.

Of course, things often don't work out as a naive student thinks. The people I
counted on weren't so in the mood of sharing like I had thought they would be.
Who have come across the link on either Reddit or HackerNews, though, have also
been very supportive and had great ideas. Nevertheless, none of them wanted to
contribute their hard-earned cash to me.

So I realised I didn't, and still don't have a plan B on how to spread the link.
Maybe I should send it to a couple of more mailing lists I follow, but I don't
really know how they would take a shameless self-advertisement, which
essentially begs for their money, without any guarrantee on any actual results.

Because this is what crowdfunding is about: you earn people's trust, and they
give you their money. How can I earn their trust? With already running projects,
and a cool story. I think I have a cool story, so it's a tick. Others might
think otherwise, but I'm confident I'm a cool guy. However, if you check out my
GitHub account, all you can find are half-done Arduino projects, with one
or two exceptions, that I'm actually proud of, along with my desktop and shell
configurations, that I'm extremely proud of. But those aren't the things most
people can relate to or even understand. Those are pure geek porn.

I don't have a tech or even a personal blog. I abandoned my [old tech
blog](https://rsdy.blogs.balabit.com/) when I quit my job, and I'm not really
eager to go back, and now, when I will upload this blog post to GitHub, I
realise it seems like this is my first blog post on the interwebs. How am I
even willing to earn people's trust, when they have no evidence that I actually
know what I'm talking about?

Even though I'm sure I know enough to complete the project, I have nothing to
prove I'm up for the task and will eventually deliver. I screwed this up many
years ago when I started to slack off from writing, and even pulled my blog
offline. But even that blog was in Hungarian, my native language, and was more
of a personal blog than a techblog documenting the amazing stuff I had done. I
actually was making many cool projects throughout high school, when that blog
was still online, and not once did I mention those projects.

I also realised that with [one apparent exception](http://techblog.vsza.hu),
the people I know, and my closest friends are not going to contribute money to
the project. That is fine, and I'm not blaming them. People in Hungary don't
really buy stuff on the Internet with credit cards, let alone spend their money
on something they won't receive within a week. I knew that all along. Friends
supported me with words, and that's enough. But as the Indiegogo tips and
tricks page mentioned, I should base 25% of my income on the family and closest
friends, which is logical: they are supposed to be the ones who trust me enough
to invest money in me, and with their contributions, they convince others to do
so as well.

But why would they spend their money on me, when they have no interest in my
project whatsoever? Even if they find the idea cool, it's not going to benefit
them in any way, or at least they don't think so.

Am I targeting the geeks after all? Did I really think this through? Do people
actually care about their privacy, or are they most comfortable using whatever
cloud services they find?

I had lots of time to think, because it was a long day yesterday. I didn't want
to go to sleep before I knew I did everything I could to set off my project. It
was a long day, for sure. I was furious answering the questions on IRC,
HackerNews and Reddit, but nothing seemed to catch people's attention. So here
you are, the things that I screwed up:

* if you can't rely on your family and friends to contribute money, people won't
  think this is a worthy project. When they see it isn't funded yet, they're most
  likely to just close the tab and move on.
* if people think your projects are fascinating that doesn't mean they're going
  to invest. You get positive responses, but not constructive criticism. Most
  people wish you luck, but don't share. You need a reliable audience who
  reshare from the very beginning.
* know who you are targeting. If your closest friends are not willing to
  contribute money, you'll most likely fail. You need to have the critical
  mass who contribute money, then others may follow.
* when you're making software, you need a public track record. Create something
  amazing, then you can make the crowd fund something more amazing.
* you need to blog. You need to show you have an understanding of what you do.
  People want to relate to you.
* don't be afraid to spread your project. People like entrepreneurs. They'll
  understand.

I hope you'll have more luck than I had in the first days. If you've come across
this post, you might want to check out my [Indiegogo
page](https://indiegogo.com/kitchensync), and I'd be grateful for a contribution
and a share as well.
